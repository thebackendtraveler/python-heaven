##  The equality operator == checks if 2 values are equal.
print("5 == 2\t", "results in\t", 5 == 2)

##  The inequality operator != checks if 2 values are not equal.
print("5 != 2\t", "results in\t", 5 != 2)

##  The greater than operator > checks if the first value is greater than the second.
print("5 > 2\t", "results in\t", 5 > 2)

##  The less / smaller than operator < checks if the first value is less than the second.
print("5 < 2\t", "results in\t", 5 < 2)

##  The greater than or equal to operator >= checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second.
print("5 >= 2\t", "results in\t", 5 >= 2)

##  The less / smaller than or equal to operator <= checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.
print("5 <= 2\t", "results in\t", 5 <= 2)
